# 20 Moonchild-2, React Portfolio

​

## Description

​Create a personal portfolio website using React, showcasing your skills and projects. The website should include multiple sections such as "About Me," "Portfolio," "Contact," and "Resume." Use React Router for navigation between different sections. Each section should have its own component, and the portfolio should feature images and details of your projects.

## Tasks

Set Up React App: Create a new React app using a tool like Vite or Create React App.

Component Creation: Develop individual React components for each section of the portfolio (e.g., About, Portfolio, Contact, Resume).

Navigation: Implement navigation using React Router to allow seamless transitions between different sections.

Styling:Apply styles to enhance the visual appeal of your portfolio using CSS or a styling library.

Project Integration: Integrate images and details of your projects into the Portfolio section.

Link Navigation: Ensure navigation links in the Header and Navigation components are correctly linked to the corresponding sections.

Responsive Design: Make the portfolio website responsive to different screen sizes for a better user experience.

Testing: Test the website to ensure all links work correctly, and the layout is consistent across different devices.

Profile Picture Adjustment: Adjust the size and styling of your profile picture in the About section.
